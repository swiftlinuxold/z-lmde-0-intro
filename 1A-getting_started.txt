SUMMARY
1.  Install LMDE in VirtualBox.  You need the guest OS for working on Swift Linux.  Unless otherwise noted, 
ALL procedures described in this file are to be done in the guest OS.
2.  Set up guest additions to allow you to share files between the host and guest OS.
3.  Update the package directory.
4.  Replace Xfce Terminal with ROX terminal.
5.  Install and set up Git.

INSTALLING LMDE
1.  Install Linux Mint Debian Edition with GNOME as the guest OS in VirtualBox.
2.  When you are finished, shut down the guest OS and take a snapshot.

SET UP GUEST ADDITIONS (allows you to share files between the host and guest OS)
1.  In the guest OS, go to the VirtualBox bar. Go to Devices -> Guest Additions.  This mounts the guest additions to
the virtual CD drive.
2.  Open the Nautilus file manager.  (You can do this by clicking on the "Computer" or "Home" icons on the desktop.)
Click on the "Open Autorun Prompt" button to run the guest additions.  (Alternative method to run the guest additions: 
From the command line, become root and enter the commands "cd /media/VBOX*" and "sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run".)
3.  As root in the guest OS, enter "mkdir /mnt/host".
4.  From the guest OS, go to Devices -> Shared Folders and select the /home/(host username)/guest directory on your 
host OS.  Select "Make Permanent" option but NOT the auto-mount option.
5.  As root in the guest OS, enter the following commands:
mkdir /mnt/host
mount -t vboxsf guest /mnt/host
6.  Now the /mnt/host directory in the guest OS is mirrored by the /home/(host OS username)/share directory in the host 
OS.  If you add a test file to the /home/(host OS username)/share directory in the host OS, it should be available in 
the /mnt/host directory in the guest OS.  (You may need to reload Nautilus to see it.)
7.  PLEASE NOTE: The file sharing capability is NOT automatic.  Each time you boot up the guest OS, you'll have to 
become root in the guest OS and enter "mount -t vboxsf guest /mnt/host" in order to resume sharing files between the 
guest and host OS.
8.  Power down VirtualBox and take a snapshot.

UPDATE THE PACKAGE DIRECTORY
1.  Some of the information in the package directory will be outdated, and you need to update it.  As root, enter 
"apt-get update" to update the package directory.
2.  After the package directory has been filled, power down VirtualBox and take a snapshot.

INSTALL AND SET UP GIT
1.  Follow the instructions at http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/ .
2.  Enter the command "mkdir ~/develop".  This is the directory where all Git repositories will be held.
3.  Power down VirtualBox and take a snapshot.

CONGRATULATIONS!  You now have everything you need to work on Swift Linux, yet still have the original LMDE 
configurations and setup.  From time to time, you'll need to return to the latest snapshot in VirtualBox to see the 
impact of your changes on the original LMDE Linux setup.
