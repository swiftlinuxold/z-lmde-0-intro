DOWNLOADING ALL ESSENTIAL REPOSITORIES
1.  As a user (NOT root), enter the following commands:
cd ~/develop
git clone git@github.com:swiftlinux/1-build.git
cd 1-build
sh preinstall.sh

DOWNLOADING ADDITIONAL GITHUB REPOSITORIES
1.  As a user (NOT root), enter "cd ~/develop".
2.  Enter "git clone (GIT URL)".  The GIT URL is the URL of the repository you need to download 
and can be found on GitHub.  For example, you can find the URL of this repository on GitHub by 
going to https://github.com/swiftlinux , selecting the 0-intro repository (which takes you to 
https://github.com/swiftlinux/0-intro), clicking on the SSH button, and looking at the URL 
just to the right of the "Git Read-Only" button.  In this case, the URL is 
git@github.com:swiftlinux/0-intro.git .  Thus the command to download the 0-intro repository is 
"git clone git@github.com:swiftlinux/0-intro.git".
3.  Repeat step 2 for all additional repositories you need to download.
4.  Please note that the 1-build repository contains a script for downloading multiple 
repositories.
